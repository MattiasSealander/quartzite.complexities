  abstract = {The impossibility of interpreting correlations of raw compositional components and associated statistical methods has been clearly demonstrated over the last four decades and alternative statistical methodology developed. Despite this a return to the “traditional” use of raw components has been advocated recently and alternative methodology such as logratio analysis strongly criticized. This paper exposes the fallacies in this recent advocacy and demonstrates the constructive role that logratio analysis can play in geological compositional problems, in particular in the investigation of natural laws and in subcompositional investigations.}

Maximum SrO concentration in the following minerals are: calcite, 7.23 wt\%; apatite, 5.22 wt\%; epidote, 11.64 wt\%; clinozoisite, 1.25 wt\%; allanite, 5.63 wt\%; britholite, 4.11 wt\% and a Sr - Na aluminosilicate ( probably stronalsite), 16.44 wt\% SrO. Calcite and apatite are chemically similar to those found in carbonatites and are therefore considered to be of igneous origin. Textural evidence indicates that the first skarn stage garnet + diopside + Sr - Na aluminosilicate formed as the result of chemical interaction between carbonatites and adjacent silicate rocks. The formation of Sr-bearing epidote/clinozoisite, allanite and britholite appears to be related to the release of Sr into the fluid phase from the breakdown of high temperature assemblages during the retrograde skarn stage. During the final evolution stages, further alteration of britholite by bastnasite and tornebohmite took place. The occurrence of REE minerals shows that the fluids responsible for this metasomatism must also have transported significant quantities of REE.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Carbonate rocks and natural waters exhibit a wide range in the concentration and isotopic composition of strontium. This wide range and the quantifiable covariation of these parameters can provide diagnostic tools for understanding processes of fluid‐rock interaction. Careful consideration of the uncertainties associated with trace element partitioning, sample heterogeneity and fluid‐rock interaction mechanisms is required to advance the application of the trace element and isotope geochemistry of strontium to studies of diagenesis, goundwater evolution, ancient seawater chemistry and isotope stratigraphy. A principal uncertainty involved in the application of Sr concentration variations to carbonate systems is the large range of experimental and empirical results for trace element partitioning of Sr between mineral and solution. This variation may be a function of precipitation rate, mineral stoichiometry, crystal growth mechanism, fluid composition and temperature. Calcite and dolomite in ancient limestones commonly have significantly lower Sr concentrations (20–70 p.p.m.) than would be expected from published trace element distribution coefficient values and Sr/Ca ratios of most modern sedimentary pore waters. This discrepancy probably reflects the uncertainties associated with determining distribution coefficient values. As techniques improve for the analytical measurement and theoretical modelling of Sr concentration and isotopic variations, the petrological analysis of carbonate samples becomes increasingly important. The presence of even small percentages of non‐carbonate phases with high Rb concentrations and high 87 Sr86 Sr values, such as clay minerals, can have significant effects on the measured 87 Sr/86 Sr values of carbonate rocks, due to the decay of 87Rb to 87 Sr. For example, a Permian marine limestone with 50 p.p.m. Sr and 1 p.p.m. Rb will have a present‐day 87 Sr/86 Sr value that is {$>$}2 × 10−4 higher than its original value. This difference is an order of magnitude greater than the analytical uncertainty, and illustrates the importance of assessing the need for and accuracy of such corrections. A quantitative evaluation of the effects of water‐rock interaction on Sr concentrations and isotope compositions in carbonates strengthens the application of these geochemical tracers. Geochemical modelling that combines the use of trace elements and isotopes can be used to distinguish between different mechanisms of water‐rock interaction, including diffusive and advective transport of diagenetic constituents in meteoric pore fluids during the recrystallization of carbonate minerals. Quantitative modelling may also be used to construct diagnostic fluid‐rock interaction trends that are independent of distribution coefficient values, and to distinguish between mixing of mineral end‐members and fluid‐rock interaction.},

Their properties are compared with those of natural outcrops, i.e. the Wommersom and Tienen quartzite and a third unknown variety. Therefore, a detailed petrographical and geochemical study is performed by means of optical microscopy, point counting, image analysis, scanning electron microscopy, hot-cathodoluminescence microscopy, inductively coupled plasma – optical emission spectrometry and portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. It is shown that the geological samples of the sedimentary quartzite varieties can be distinguished based on their texture and composition. The results of the grain size distribution indicate that there is a clear contrast between the fine-grained Wommersom quartzite versus the much coarser-grained Tienen quartzite. On the other hand, the concentrations of the chemical elements zirconium, titanium and iron show a difference between the three quartzite varieties, with the aid of discriminant function analysis. These criteria are applied to a number of archaeological artefacts showing that most of the investigated samples are composed of the fine-grained Wommersom quartzite. The provenance of the more coarser-grained artefacts is still unknown.},

  abstract = {The garnet-biotite-sillimanite anatectic xenoliths in the Neogene dacite dome of El Joyazo (also called Cerro de Hoyazo, SE Spain) contain four types of graphite (I to IV), distinguished on the basis of grain size and texture. Structural characterization of graphite by Laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) shows systematic differences in the degree of ordering among the four types: only type III is fully consistent with the granulite-facies conditions reached by the xenoliths during partial melting, the others indicate metamorphic temperatures covering amphibolite-facies conditions, with only a few examples of granulite-grade crystallinity. All graphite crystallized before or during the anatectic event, indicating that a large fraction of the graphite did not equilibrate at peak temperatures. The mm-scale coexistence of different types and degrees of ordering in the graphite suggests different origins, i.e. of biogenic derivation and “fluid-deposited”, and is explained in terms of fluid-melt-graphite interaction during the anatectic event. Disequilibrium behaviour during high-temperature metamorphism and anatexis is typical of types I, II and particularly of IV, and is attributed to sluggish kinetics of solid-state graphitization, mainly owing to the limited time of the process and carbon saturation of the intergranular fluid. The coexisting, well-ordered type III graphite is the product of melting in the presence of a graphite-saturated fluid, a process that would account for the deposition of new graphite. The LRS results, together with petrologic observations, suggest that it is possible that high melt fractions can be generated by fluid-present melting of a metasedimentary protolith also in a closed system. Although this contradicts the commonly accepted hypothesis that, due to limited rock porosities, extensive fluid-present melting is precluded unless infiltration occurs, it is a possible end-member model in anatectic settings characterized by rapid heating rates and low-grade source rocks.},

abstract = {One way of characterising clay minerals is by means of their vibrational spectra. These spectra are complicated because they reflect the structural complexity of clay minerals on the scale of the chemical bond and their chemical, mineralogical, geological or other heterogeneity on any larger scale. This chapter introduces methods for extracting the information content of vibrational spectra of clay minerals. A number of popular mathematical pretreatments regarding the smoothing of noise, the elimination of nonvibrational responses (conversely, the selective enhancement of the vibrational features) or the various normalisations needed for spectral comparisons is reviewed. The two main techniques for analysing complex band shapes, namely band decomposition and derivative analysis, are compared in detail. Whereas these pretreatments can be applied to single spectra, a different approach is needed to mine the information hidden in large spectral datasets. Multivariate analysis is introduced as a toolbox for expressing the spectral variability within such datasets in terms of latent independent descriptors (vectors, loadings, principal components) and also for correlating (projecting) the latent structures with independent measurements on the same set of samples (chemometrics). A section is devoted to the desired characteristics of the spectral and independent property datasets, and another to validation procedures, which are critical for determining the nontrivial dimensionality, hence the robustness, of the method. Examples of two of the most popular multivariate techniques, principal component analysis and partial least squares are provided in the context of fundamental research and industrial applications, respectively.}

  abstract = {The structures and compositions of modern and fossil charcoal samples were compared in order to evaluate charcoal degradation processes in archaeological sites. Modern charcoal samples produced in campfires contain two major phases: graphite-like microcrystallites and a non-organized phase. These phases create a mosaic-like structure with differing relative proportions depending on the taxonomic source of the wood used. Fossil charcoal samples (Tel Dor, Israel: 3000 years BP and Kebara Cave, Israel: 40,000 years BP) also contained the graphite-like microcrystallites and the non-organized phases, but were clearly altered compared to modern charcoal. The graphite-like phase of the fossil charcoal has much higher electrical resistivity, and its ESR properties show that it has markedly altered surface electronic states. Infrared spectra show the presence of additional carboxylate groups. Oxidation has therefore altered the structure. This appears to be a “self-humification” process that affects the graphitic component, and probably the non-organized phase as well.},

The band shift corresponds to an increase in the Alvi content of muscovite, determined by electron microprobe, and is thus a monitor of Al2Si-1(Fe,Mg)-1 (Tschermak) exchange. Spectroscopic measurements such as these are useful in the case of aluminum-deficient rocks, which lack metamorphic index minerals or appropriate assemblages for thermobarometric studies, and in low-grade rocks (subgarnet zone), which lack quantitative indicators of metamorphic grade and are too fine grained for petrographic or microprobe studies. More important, spectroscopic detection of mineral-chemical variations in metamorphic rocks provides petrologists with a tool to recover information on metamorphic reaction histories from high-spectral-resolution aircraft or satellite remote sensing data.},

  abstract = {The temperature dependence of the room pressure Raman spectra of the GeO2 (hexagonal and tetragonal) and SiO2 (quartz, coesite, and stishovite) polymorphs is presented. Several transformations upon heating are reported: α‐β quartz, coesite‐cristobalite, stishovite‐silica glass (with Si in four‐fold coordination). For all the compounds, Raman frequencies decrease linearly with temperature and the measured shifts are used in conjunction with available high‐pressure Raman data to calculate for each compound intrinsic mode anharmonicity through the parameter ai=(∂lnVi/∂T)v. In quartz the modes related to the α‐β transition (128 and 207 cm−1 modes) are highly anharmonic (ai=−20×10−5 K−11). In coesite many bands are unaffected by temperature and only two modes (77 and 116 cm−1) show significant anharmonic behaviour. Tetragonal GeO2 and stishovite behave similarly under temperature. Vibrational modeling of the specific heat and entropy, including anharmonic corrections deduced from the ai parameters, are presented and compared to available calorimetric measurements. For the GeO2 polymorphs the agreement between calculated and measured values is within 1–3\% in the temperature range 100 to 1500 K. For quartz the agreement is similar over the range 50–850 K. For coesite and stishovite the models reproduce existing low temperature measurements. High‐temperature values of Cp and entropy are proposed for coesite and stishovite.}

The protocol outlines best practices for the collection of geochemical data using pXRF from glacoiogenic sediments with generally continental crustal abundance elemental concentrations at a fraction of the cost of traditional laboratory methods. The analytical protocol considers 1) sample preparation, 2) sample analysis, and 3) data cleaning, examination and presentation. The protocol takes into consideration pXRF fundamentals related to, instrument configuration, and an assessment of measurement parameters, including peak overlaps, dwell time, instrument drift, in-situ versus processed samples, variable grain size and moisture content effects, and comparison to traditional laboratory methods. Protocol development occurred over a number of years and analysis of over 4000 geological samples and \textasciitilde 9000 analysis of Certified and Standard Reference Materials.},

  abstract = {Formal technologies and intensified reduction are often seen as responses to increased mobility and low abundance of lithic raw material of good flakeability and controllability. In this paper, we discuss an alternative explanation to this hypothesis using the change in tool raw material experienced by flint-using pioneers, as they had to go from a formal blade technology to a simple flake technology as they settled in Scandinavia. The region is dominated by quartz, and we use use-wear data as a means to evaluate the role of this type of raw material compared to the use profile of flint assemblages in the home territories of the pioneers. Although the technology changed through simplification and loss of formal production rules, due to the low workability of quartz, we conclude that changes in the foraging range into areas of different quality tool raw materials does not need formalization of the technology. The quartz in our sample was produced with a simple platform/bipolar technology and used for a wide variety of activities in every aspect comparable to the range of uses identified in the contemporaneous blade assemblages based on flint. Instead of formalization of the lithic technology to cope with different quality raw materials, it was diversified and simplified. The organisational dimensions and design criteria of the bone technology, whereby simple flakes were used as insets in slotted tools, did not have to change in this process.},

  abstract = {Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a graphene-like material that exhibits high productivity for a wide range of industrial applications. To promote the application of rGO, it is important to not only produce high-quality rGO but also precisely evaluate the output. The intensity ratio of the D to G band in the Raman scattering is commonly used to assess the defect density of the carbon materials; however, this ratio is limited to evaluate the reduction degree of rGO because of the ambiguity arising from the superposition of the bands. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the intensity ratio of D* to G band and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) to evaluate the degree of reduction of rGO. The spectral analysis of GO and rGO, along with systematic research of the thermally reduced GO synthesized via thermal treatment (100–900 °C) revealed a strong linkage between the D*/G intensity ratio and the C/O atomic ratio. The atomic vibrational relationships were elucidated by the assignment of the D* band, based on the density functional perturbation theory calculations. These findings explain the atomic vibrational properties of rGO and provide an indicator of the quality of rGO to optimize its performance for applications.},

  abstract = {One of the challenges of using Raman spectroscopy for biological applications is the inherent fluorescence generated by many biological molecules that underlies the measured spectra. This fluorescence can sometimes be several orders of magnitude more intense than the weak Raman scatter, and its presence must be minimized in order to resolve and analyze the Raman spectrum. Several techniques involving hardware and software have been devised for this purpose; these include the use of wavelength shifting, time gating, frequency-domain filtering, first- and second-order derivatives, and simple curve fitting of the broadband variation with a high-order polynomial. Of these, polynomial fitting has been found to be a simple but effective method. However, this technique typically requires user intervention and thus is time consuming and prone to variability. An automated method for fluorescence subtraction, based on a modification to least-squares polynomial curve fitting, is described. Results indicate that the presented automated method is proficient in fluorescence subtraction, repeatability, and in retention of Raman spectral lineshapes.},

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy has historically played an important role in the structural characterization of graphitic materials, in particular providing valuable information about defects, stacking of the graphene layers and the finite sizes of the crystallites parallel and perpendicular to the hexagonal axis. Here we review the defect-induced Raman spectra of graphitic materials from both experimental and theoretical standpoints and we present recent Raman results on nanographites and graphenes. The disorder-induced D and D′ Raman features, as well as the G′-band (the overtone of the D-band which is always observed in defect-free samples), are discussed in terms of the double-resonance (DR) Raman process, involving phonons within the interior of the 1st Brillouin zone of graphite and defects. In this review, experimental results for the D, D′ and G′ bands obtained with different laser lines, and in samples with different crystallite sizes and different types of defects are presented and discussed. We also present recent advances that made possible the development of Raman scattering as a tool for very accurate structural analysis of nano-graphite, with the establishment of an empirical formula for the in- and out-of-plane crystalline size and even fancier Raman-based information, such as for the atomic structure at graphite edges, and the identification of single versus multi-graphene layers. Once established, this knowledge provides a powerful machinery to understand newer forms of sp2 carbon materials, such as the recently developed pitch-based graphitic foams. Results for the calculated Raman intensity of the disorder-induced D-band in graphitic materials as a function of both the excitation laser energy (Elaser) and the in-plane size (La) of nano-graphites are presented and compared with experimental results. The status of this research area is assessed, and opportunities for future work are identified.}

The second characterised the material from archaeological sites using only petrographic or geochemical perspectives of a limited sample. Currently, both perspectives are unconnected, creating a methodological gap that needs to be solved to study the procurement and management of quartzite in greater depth. The present study, mainly methodological, will explore the gap between petrographic analysis and non-destructive characterisation. Doing so, we could fill this vacuum of information and generate a solid geoarchaeological basis to characterise not only a sample but complete assemblages. To this end, we analyse the lithic assemblages at El Arteu and El Habario, two Middle-Palaeolithic sites in the Cantabrian Region, northern Spain. We summarise the main results derived from petrographic analysis, but especially we will focus on non-destructive criteria to characterise the lithic surfaces of archaeological quartzite using stereoscope microscopy. This process allows us to understand the complete assemblage but also, through technological characterisation, understand the management of different quartzite petrogenetic types in both sites.}

  abstract = {Raw material characterization in Paleolithic archaeology has widened our knowledge of Middle Paleolithic societies. Procurement of raw material, specifically flint, has allowed the tracing of the mobility of both stones and people, as well as selective processes to obtain specific types or even extraction activities. The analysis of quartzite has also developed in recent years, providing an opportunity to better understand prehistoric societies. This study characterizes the procurement strategies implemented by Middle Paleolithic people in the mountainous region of the Picos de Europa. To this end, we present a comprehensive characterization of potential catchment areas: massive outcrops, conglomerates, and river deposits. The exploitation of quartzite at the sites of El Habario and El Arteu allows us to understand the territorial management of this mountainous area through the combination of selective processes and mobility mechanisms in lower and middle altitudes. These perspectives enable us to view the mountainous region not as a barrier but as an environmental mosaic managed by Middle Paleolithic groups. This study shows strategies that bring together direct and embedded procurement based on both intensive and extensive searches. These discourses are more closely related to the daily life of people than those only considering the mobility of people and objects. A comprehensive geoarchaeological research project based on the integration of a geographic information system, field survey, stereomicroscopy, and thin‐section petrography, is presented to characterize potential procurement areas of quartzite. The application of this methodology in the Deva, Cares, and Güeña valleys and in three different geological contexts;~massive outcrops, conglomerates, and secondary deposits, suggest potential acquisition processes of lithic resources. The analysis of the quartzite assemblages of El Habario and El Arteu unveils complex management of terrain based on a mobility mechanism that connects middle altitude plateaus with open and lower river valleys, as well as intensive and extensive procurement mechanisms of raw material.},

On the other hand, Raman spectroscopy provides quantitative data on quartz, magnetite, maghemite, and kenomagnetite and compositional information on aluminous goethite, hematite, and carbonates. The development of automated spectral systems with the ability to scan large volume of samples has been a catalyst for the routine use of these techniques in iron ore. These systems can be applied to rock hand samples, drill chips, diamond cores, mine faces, and the whole mine either for exploration, processing, or environmental monitoring.}

However, compositional data do not vary independently, and a concentration based approach to data analysis can lead to faulty conclusions. For this reason a better statistical approach was introduced in the 1980s, exclusively based on relative information. Because the difference between the two methods should be most pronounced in large-scale, and therefore highly variable, datasets, here a new dataset of agricultural soils, covering all of Europe (5.6millionkm2) at an average sampling density of 1site/2500km2, is used to demonstrate and compare both approaches. Absolute element concentrations are certainly of interest in a variety of applications and can be provided in tabulations or concentration maps. Maps for the opened data (ratios to other elements) provide more specific additional information. For compositional data XY plots for raw or log-transformed data should only be used with care in an exploratory data analysis (EDA) sense, to detect unusual data behaviour, candidate subgroups of samples, or to compare pre-defined groups of samples. Correlation analysis and the Euclidean distance are not mathematically meaningful concepts for this data type. Element relationships have to be investigated via a stability measure of the (log-)ratios of elements. Logratios are also the key ingredient for an appropriate multivariate analysis of compositional data.}

  abstract = {Savitzky–Golay (SG) filtering, based on local least-squares fitting of the data by polynomials, is a popular method for smoothing data and calculations of derivatives of noisy data. At frequencies above the cutoff, SG filters have poor noise suppression; this unnecessarily reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, especially when calculating derivatives of the data. In addition, SG filtering near the boundaries of the data range is prone to artifacts, which are especially strong when using SG filters for calculating derivatives of the data. We show how these disadvantages can be avoided while keeping the advantageous properties of SG filters. We present two classes of finite impulse response (FIR) filters with substantially improved frequency response: (i) SG filters with fitting weights in the shape of a window function and (ii) convolution kernels based on the sinc function with a Gaussian-like window function and additional corrections for improving the frequency response in the passband (modified sinc kernel). Compared with standard SG filters, the only price to pay for the improvement is a moderate increase in the kernel size. Smoothing at the boundaries of the data can be improved with a non-FIR method, the Whittaker–Henderson smoother, or by linear extrapolation of the data, followed by convolution with a modified sinc kernel, and we show that the latter is preferable in most cases. We provide computer programs and equations for the smoothing parameters of these smoothers when used as plug-in replacements for SG filters and describe how to choose smoothing parameters to preserve peak heights in spectra.}

  abstract = {To provide a new reconstruction of the deglaciation of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, in the form of calendar-year time-slices, which are particularly useful for ice sheet modelling, we have compiled and synthesized published geomorphological data for eskers, ice-marginal formations, lineations, marginal meltwater channels, striae, ice-dammed lakes, and geochronological data from radiocarbon, varve, optically-stimulated luminescence, and cosmogenic nuclide dating. This is summarized as a deglaciation map of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet with isochrons marking every 1000 years between 22 and 13~cal~kyr BP and every hundred years between 11.6 and final ice decay after 9.7~cal~kyr BP. Deglaciation patterns vary across the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet domain, reflecting differences in climatic and geomorphic settings as well as ice sheet basal thermal conditions and terrestrial versus marine margins. For example, the ice sheet margin in the high-precipitation coastal setting of the western sector responded sensitively to climatic variations leaving a detailed record of prominent moraines and other ice-marginal deposits in many fjords and coastal valleys. Retreat rates across the southern sector differed between slow retreat of the terrestrial margin in western and southern Sweden and rapid retreat of the calving ice margin in the Baltic Basin. Our reconstruction is consistent with much of the published research. However, the synthesis of a large amount of existing and new data support refined reconstructions in some areas. For example, the LGM extent of the ice sheet in northwestern Russia was located far east and it occurred at a later time than the rest of the ice sheet, at around 17–15~cal~kyr BP. We also propose a slightly different chronology of moraine formation over southern Sweden based on improved correlations of moraine segments using new LiDAR data and tying the timing of moraine formation to Greenland ice core cold stages. Retreat rates vary by as much as an order of magnitude in different sectors of the ice sheet, with the lowest rates on the high-elevation and maritime Norwegian margin. Retreat rates compared to the climatic information provided by the Greenland ice core record show a general correspondence between retreat rate and climatic forcing, although a close match between retreat rate and climate is unlikely because of other controls, such as topography and marine versus terrestrial margins. Overall, the time slice reconstructions of Fennoscandian Ice Sheet deglaciation from 22 to 9.7~cal~kyr BP provide an important dataset for understanding the contexts that underpin spatial and temporal patterns in retreat of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, and are an important resource for testing and refining ice sheet models.},

In this article we present an experimental study of quartz flake fragmentation. We evaluate the method called fracture analysis that has been developed and used explicitly for the study of quartz assemblages. The method assumes high predictability of quartz flake fragmentation, but our experiments show that there is significant variation in fragmentation that fracture analysis does not take into account. Our results indicate that this variation is partly explained by indenter hardness, the relative thickness of the detached flake, as well as individual knapper-related factors. These results undermine the applicability of quartz fracture analysis in its current form. In addition, we discuss the effects of flake fragmentation...},

  abstract = {Radiative transfer theory will assist in determining olivine and pyroxene proportions and compositions from the surface of a planetary body composed of intimately mixed minerals. In order to use radiative transfer techniques, the model requires the optical constants of olivine and pyroxene. Optical constants are parameters that describe the degree light absorbed (k) and refracted (n) in a medium. Here we only parameterize k in the near infrared from 0.6 to 2.5?µm of natural olivine as a function of forsterite number and synthetic pyroxene with respect to wollastonite and ferrosilite number. In contrast to previous work, this study is an improvement on previous work because we have a diverse and larger sample size leading to robust optical parameters. Additionally, we characterize each k-spectrum with the modified Gaussian model (MGM). MGM is a physically realistic model of near-infrared absorptions due to electronic transitions. In each spectrum, we model each absorption and continuum with Gaussians and an inverse of a linear function, respectively. We find that our fitting routine characterizes the olivine and pyroxene k-spectra in a robust and consistent manner. Then we use regression analysis to characterize each parameter of the Gaussians and the continuum as a function of mineral composition. The developed optical parameters from this work will allow calculations of mineral proportions and compositions on planetary surfaces with use of data from missions such as Dawn, MESSENGER, SELENE, and Chandrayaan-1.},

Thirty graphite-schist blocks were studied to discover all the varieties in this classic locality of mélange. Based on their mineralogical assemblage and composition, and textural characteristics the graphite-schists in San Simeon are subdivided into two main types (Type I and II) with two subdivisions each (A and B). Type IA and IIA blocks are the most abundant. Type IA graphite-schists are siltstone/fine greywacke-like, preserve sedimentary textures, and lack lawsonite. Type IB graphite-schists are mineralogical and texturally similar to Type IA schists, but are finer grained siltstone and shale. Type IIA graphite-schists are compositionally layered and contain quartz- and albite-rich layers and dark graphite- and intergrown mica/chlorite-rich layers. Nine out of the 15 Type IIA blocks contain lawsonite. Two Type IIA blocks also contain aragonite (+calcite) in veins. Type IIB graphite-schists are mostly composed of quartz and minor graphite, intergrown chlorite and white mica, and white mica pseudomorphs after lawsonite. The phengite content of mica in Type IIA blocks is higher than that of mica in Type IA graphite-schists, confirming they were metamorphosed under high-P/low-T conditions. Type IA blocks were recrystallized between 200 and 250~°C at {$<\sptilde$}3~kbar; whereas, Type IIA blocks were metamorphosed under~higher pressure conditions, probably at 250?300~°C and 3?5~kbar. Most likely both types of graphite-schists were derived from a similar layered siltstone/fine greywacke/shale protolith. Organic matter-rich sediments deposited in the trench axis were subducted along with oceanic crust during Franciscan subduction. Type I graphite-schists were subducted to depths {$<$}10~km, whereas Type II graphite-schists were subducted to depths \textasciitilde 15~km where they were underplated under high-P conditions. The graphitic metasedimentary rocks were juxtaposed with mafic lithologies from the subducted oceanic crust that were metamorphosed to blueschist facies and retrograded to greenstone as they returned to the surface in the subduction channel shear zone.},

  abstract = {Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and carbon nanofibers (CNF) were created using chemical vapor deposition at growth temperatures between 500 and 750°C, which have increasing crystallinity with increasing growth temperature. We used Raman spectroscopy to analyze the samples. The intensity ratios compared to the G-band, and full-width at half-maximum, of all observable Raman bands in both the first and second-order region were investigated. Good match was observed for the defect related bands of the MWCNT samples and data found in the literature. Several second-order bands display a strong dependency to growth temperature. Similar growth temperature (and thus defect) dependencies were found between several first and second-order bands, which might aid in determining the physical causes of these bands. CNF show much weaker Raman features due to their low crystallinity, making them more difficult to analyse. The results of this work are used to give recommendations on how to investigate MWCNT and CNF crystallinity using Raman spectroscopy. Finally, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between the MWCNT root and tip growth mechanism.}

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy has been widely used in mineralogy and petrology for identifying mineral phases. Some recent applications of Raman spectroscopy involve measuring the residual pressure of mineral inclusions, such as quartz inclusions in garnet host, to recover the entrapment pressure condition during metamorphism. The crystallographic orientations of entrapped inclusions and host are important to know for the modelling of their elastic interaction. However, the analysis of tiny entrapped mineral inclusions using EBSD technique requires time consuming polishing. The crystallographic orientations can be measured using polarized Raman spectroscopy, as the intensities of Raman bands depend on the mutual orientation between the polarization direction of the laser and the crystallographic orientation of the crystal. In this study, the Raman polarizability tensor of quartz is first obtained and is used to fit arbitrary orientations of quartz grains. We have implemented two rotation methods: (1) sample rotation method, where the sample is rotated on a rotation stage, and (2) polarizer rotation method, where the polarization directions of the incident laser and the scattered Raman signal are parallel and can be rotated using a circular polarizer. The precision of the measured crystallographic orientation is systematically studied and is shown to be ca. 0.25 degrees using quartz wafers and quartz plates that are cut along known orientations. It is shown that the orientation of tiny mineral inclusions (ca. 2–5~μm) can be precisely determined and yield consistent results with EBSD.}
